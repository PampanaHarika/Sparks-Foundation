                The second wave of COVID-19 hit rural India hard. In May, 53% of all new cases were being reported from the country’s hinterlands and accounted for every second death from the virus. The only option to put an end to the pandemic is to vaccinate all eligible citizens.While in cities there is awareness and  availability  of vaccines, in our rural communities the reality is very different.According to  The Hindu, by mid-May, 30.3% of India’s urban population  had received at least one dose of  the vaccine compared to just 12.7% in rural areas.There are multiple factors like lack of access,digital illiteracy, vaccine hesitancy due to rumours and misinformation etc.., that have led to a slower and unequal rollout of vaccination in rural India.To accelerate the vaccination process in rural communities, GiveIndia is launching Mission Vaccination For All.This mission will not only help rural India get quicker and easier access to the vaccines,it will also help create awareness by busting myths and misinformation.GiveIndia will partner with state governments and local bodies for training of nurses, paramedics, ASHA workers, and community health workers. We will help bridge the digital divide and facilitate last mile delivery in rural areas especially in aspirational districts.<br><br>While we immunise ourselves with the first and second jabs, let us not forget our rural counterparts - because no one is safe till everyone is. Join Mission Vaccination For All and help immunise India against COVID-19. #TogetherWeFight
